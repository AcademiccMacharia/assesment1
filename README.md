# ASSESMENT 1

This is first weekly assesment done as part of the Jitu program that seeks to test our understanding of the concepts of JavaScript that were learnt during the week on JavaScript hoisting, ES6 features as well as Hoisting and loops.

Feel free to check them out and drop me a line incase of any enquiries.
