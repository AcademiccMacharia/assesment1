// let sum = 5+ 5+"5";

// console.log(sum);

let answer = "Given the above the log will return 105, this is because the five being enclosed using quotes means it will be interpreted as a string rather than as an interger therefore resulting in only the addition of the first two fives happening then the last five is concanated hence the result is 105.";
